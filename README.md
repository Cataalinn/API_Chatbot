Overview
====
This is a Python client for a Flower Delivery Chatbot that I made using [API.AI](http://www.api.ai). The bot will have a full conversation with the user, from intial proposal to order delivery status. This is the code for Machine Learning for Hackers #9 on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6R3EjMQ7H0).


## Dependencies
- [python 2.7](https://www.google.com/#q=python+2.7)
- [API.AI](https://github.com/api-ai/api-ai-python)
- [virtualenv] (https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)

## Basic Usage
To run, type the following into terminal

`python demo.py `

The conversation will start! All the chatbot logic happens in the API.AI console You can exit the conversation by just typing 'exit' into the chat.
